                  <p>
                    Utility Patent Drawings are technical illustrations submitted as part of a utility patent application.
                    They visually represent the functional and structural aspects of an invention and are required whenever
                    drawings are necessary to understand the invention. Utility patent drawings complement the written
                    description and are a legal requirement in most jurisdictions (such as the USPTO and EPO) unless the
                    invention can be fully understood without them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unlike design patents, which protect the ornamental appearance of a product, utility patents protect how
                    a product, system, or process worksâ€”and the drawings must illustrate this clearly and accurately.
                  </p>

                  <h4 className="mt-4 mb-3">ðŸ§© When Are Drawings Required?</h4>
                  <ul className="list-style-two mb-0">
                    <li>To understand the structure or operation of the invention</li>
                    <li>To show components, connections, or internal workings</li>
                    <li>To illustrate sequences, flowcharts, or processes (e.g., in software or methods)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p className="mt-3">
                    Drawings are generally mandatory; they are only omitted when the invention is purely conceptual and can
                    be fully described in textâ€”which is extremely rare in practice.
