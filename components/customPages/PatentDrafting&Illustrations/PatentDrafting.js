                  <p>
                    Patent Drafting is the process of preparing a detailed and legally enforceable document that describes an invention clearly, 
                    accurately, and in a way that meets the requirements of patent offices. The resulting document, called a patent application, 
                    is submitted to secure exclusive rights over the invention.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    High-quality patent drafting is crucial to the strength, scope, and enforceability of a patent. A poorly drafted patent 
                    may be rejected, easily circumvented, or invalidated in litigation.
