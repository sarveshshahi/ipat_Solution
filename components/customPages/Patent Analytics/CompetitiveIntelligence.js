                  <p>
                    Competitive Intelligence (CI) is the systematic process of collecting, analyzing, and applying information about competitors,
                    market trends, technologies, and the overall business environment to support strategic decision-making.
                    The goal of CI is to help organizations anticipate market moves, identify opportunities and threats,
                    and maintain or improve competitive advantage.

                  <p>
                    CI involves gathering data from publicly available sources, analyzing it, and converting it into actionable insights about:

                  <ul className="list-style-two mb-4">
                    <li>Competitors’ products, strategies, and performance</li>
                    <li>Market dynamics and customer needs</li>
                    <li>Emerging technologies and innovation trends</li>
                    <li>Regulatory and geopolitical factors</li>
                    <li>Industry best practices and benchmarks</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    CI is legal and ethical when focused on public, non-confidential information, distinguishing it from industrial espionage.
